# Requirements 
- PyPSA (`conda install -c conda-forge pypsa`)
- gurobi and gurobipy (`conda install -c gurobi gurobi` and `pip install gurobipy`) + full license
- openpyxl (`conda install -c anaconda onpenpyxl`)

# Code
File to run for modeling and optimising the system: **run.py**.
This file currently models an electricity scenario of 2050. All the data used for this modeling can be updated from the Data folder.

This file calls **functions_used.py** where few functions are defined, mostly for the formatting of the data.

In **energy_network.py**, the class EnergyNetwork is defined, importing and optimising the network. In **electricity_production.py**, **electrical_grid.py**, **electrical_demand.py** and **hydrogen_elements.py**, the elements of the network are created following the name of the file.
In **additional_constraints.py**, two functions for the definition of constraints and resulting impacts are introduced.

# Scenarios
A lot of scenarios are introduced in the code and can be found on the first sheet of **data20X0.xlsx**. 
- electricity production: variation in installed electricity generation capacity;
- electricity consumption: variation in basic electricity consumption;
- electric vehicles: percentages of controllable electric fleet, total additional demand for vehicles;
- buses: electric bus frequency scenario;
- climate: BRIO project scenario (IPCC, data not on the repository);
- hydrogen: use of hydrogen in the system.

Within the hydrogen scenarios, several scenarios/data are imported depending on the case study:
- scenarios: storage, bus (number of stations and dispensers), train;
- consumption: time series of consumption at HRS according to station configuration.

# Data
The different data required are stored in **.csv** or **.xslx** files.
The following data files are used in the code :
- *data20X0.xlsx* :  excel with all data other than time series (technical, economic data, etc.)
	- Carrier : energy vectors or energies used, used only for graphics
	- Generator : technical and economic data for electricity production
	- Rayonnement_ps : links a weather station with radiation data to a source station
	- Temp√©rature_ps : links a weather station with temperature data to a source station
	- Load_ps : assimilates source substations without transformers to the nearest source substation with a transformer
	- Load_buses : assimilates charging source stations according to bus network and power generation scenario
	- Link : technical and economic data for hydrogen systems
	- Batteries : technical and economic data for existing batteries
	- Storage : technical and economic data for additional storage (batteries, hydrogen)
	- Units
